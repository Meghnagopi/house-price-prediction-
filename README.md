# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to use various features (like median income, location, number of rooms, etc.) to build a regression model that can estimate house values.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Built a machine learning model using **Linear Regression**
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values and categorical variables)
- Explored feature correlations
- Visualized predictions vs actual prices
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² Score

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- End-to-end project workflow for supervised ML
- Feature engineering (handling categorical data with dummy variables)
- Model evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- Visualizing model predictions
- Understanding real-world datasets

---

## 📈 Results

- **RMSE**: ~69,000 (avg. error in price prediction)
- **R² Score**: ~0.63 (63% of price variance explained by the model)
- **Best predictor**: Median income

## ✅ Next Steps (optional)

- Try other algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Scale features using StandardScaler
- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
